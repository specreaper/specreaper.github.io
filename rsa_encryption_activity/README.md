1. What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?
    - Symmetric uses the same key for encryption and decryption
    - Asymmetric uses uses two different keys one public key for encryption and one private key for decryption

2. Explain the steps of the encryption and decryption process
    - First using one key turns regualer text into ciphertext
    - Then once the ciphertext arrives at its destination another key is used to turn the ciphertext back into regualer text 

3. Why is it important that you never share your secret key?
    - Because if someone has your privite key anyone can see your messages.
