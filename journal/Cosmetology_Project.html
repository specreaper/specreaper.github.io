		<h1><u>Cosmetology Project Journal</u></h1>
		<p>The purpose of my form is to allow people to make reservations for an appointment in the Cosmetology room</p>
		<p>In my form I used the input types:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Email</li>
			<li>Text with a partern to make it they had to type a phone number</li>
			<li>Time with a min time of 8:00 am and a max time of 4:00 pm</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The request method I used is POST.</p> 
		<p>During the devolpment process of this project I didn't have any problems with pulling, merging, or the branch-based development, apart from when we had some problems because we forgot to make a .gitignore file and DS_Store caused some bugs.</p>
